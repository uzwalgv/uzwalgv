Hi there 👋

Since 2016, I have helped companies build data analytics solutions.

I have worked with Senior directors to managers that helped them tap value out of data 🤑 and reduce manual work.

I am a process and outcome-orientated data analytics professional with comprehensive experience in Snowflake and Hadoop 🐘 stack.

My strengths are in data engineering, modeling, analytics, and maintaining solutions to support smooth business operations.

Apart from my day job, I love reading books 📚, playing chess 👑 , badminton 🏸.

Thanks,
Uzwal
